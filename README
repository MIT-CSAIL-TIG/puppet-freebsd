freebsd

This is the freebsd module.  It contains classes, types, and facts useful
for FreeBSD systems.

What's in it
------------
* rc_conf, periodic_conf, loader_conf - manage the contents of the named
files.  These are based on the examples from the Puppet Wiki, and depend
on the shell_config type (defined in our shell_config module), which really
should be a Puppet core type.  Note that the Augeas lens that shell_config
currently depends on fails on loader.conf files that contain tunables,
because the shell (unlike /boot/loader) doesn't allow dots in variable names.
This will need to be fixed in the FreeBSD Augeas port or upstream Augeas;
we use a custom hacked package.

* ipfw - simple firewall configuration.  Currently this only implements the
standard firewall types known by /etc/rc.firewall (and all it does is put
the relevant thing into /etc/rc.conf); if you specify a pathname as the
firewall type, a dependency will be created automatically (but it's up
to you to define the resource); there are too many different ways firewall
rules can be defined.  You might build a more complicated data model on top
of this module.  It defines Service['firewall'].

* pf - stub class for future use.  This class would implement the same
interface for pf as the ipfw class does for the standard firewall, perhaps
with some extra pf-specific features.  It also defines Service['firewall'].

* localbase - a fact that determines the package prefix (by calling
"pkg query", so pkgng is mandatory) so that Puppet modules do not need
to hardcode this configuration variable.  So named because it's the
counterpart to ${LOCALBASE} in bsd.port.mk.  It should be defined by
the FreeBSD puppet port instead, and then it could be hard-coded to the
correct value, eliminating a fork/exec from fact resolution.

Features will be removed from this module if and when comparable features
are added to mainline Puppet or to the FreeBSD puppet port.
